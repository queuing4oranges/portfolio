It also displays the final project from the Web Development Bootcamp I joined in 2022, as well as projects I finished on my own, projects from video tutorials, or results from other resources of study. The biggest struggle was being able to dive into the work without guidance, though I would argue that having conquered that was also the biggest joy!",

      "description": "The Lesbotoč Website project will go live as soon as finishing touches are made by the team and in cooperation with the organization, which is part of the LGBT+ community. The project was made by a team of three. All of us worked on backend and frontend, because everyone wanted to be involved in the whole process. That way, we all had a part in creating tables, modeling, and seeding data to the database. The project was planned and designed in Figma. The team worked agile with the help of Trello. My part of the backend was 'locations', including a form to add a new location to the database. My work on the frontend was the 'about-us' page, as well as the footer of the website.",
