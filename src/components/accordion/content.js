The project was made by a team of three. All of us worked on backend and frontend, because everyone wanted to be involved in the whole process. That way, we all had a part in creating tables, modelling, and seeding data to the database. The project was planned and designed in Figma. The team worked agile with the help of Trello. My part of the backend was 'locations', including a form to add a new location to the database. My work on the frontend was the 'about-us' page, as well as the footer of the website.",
